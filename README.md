# Traffic-Light-Classifier-using-traditional-computer-vision-techniques
In this project, I used tradtional computer vision techniques for classification of traffic light signal.
The steps followed in this project are:
1. Loading and visualizing the data. 
2. Pre-processing the input images and output labels need to be standardized. 
3. Feature extraction from the image which will be utilized to do the classification.
4. Classification and visualizing error. This step involves predicting the label for the test images and displaying the output and analyzing the errors.
